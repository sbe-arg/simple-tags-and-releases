## USAGE

```yaml
with:
  autogenerated_notes: 'true|false' # defaults to 'true' to leverage github autogenerated notes in the release

```

```yaml
name: tag-and-release

  push:
    branches:
      - main

## what for: simple release processes

- non automated versioning, tags and releases based on content of a file

## what not: try to keep it simple

- no support for pre_releases
- no automatic semantic versioning
